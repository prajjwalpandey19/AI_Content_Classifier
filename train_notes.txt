Training notes for full accuracy:
- Use GPU runtime (Colab) or a machine with CUDA-enabled GPU.
- Recommended epochs: 30-100 depending on dataset size.
- Use larger embedding and LSTM sizes if dataset is large (>10k samples).
- Consider pretraining/fine-tuning transformers (huggingface) for best results.
