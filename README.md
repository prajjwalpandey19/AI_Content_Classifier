# 🧠 AI_Content_Classifier

## 📘 Project Description
The **AI_Content_Classifier** is a Deep Learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that can **identify whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.).  

It helps detect AI-generated content in research papers, assignments, articles, and online posts by analyzing **linguistic style, structure, and semantic patterns**.

This project is designed to assist educators, researchers, and organizations in promoting **authentic human-written content** and minimizing AI-generated plagiarism.

## 🎯 Objective
To build an intelligent model using **Deep Learning (LSTM)** and **Natural Language Processing** that can automatically classify text into two categories:

- 🤖 **AI-generated content**  
- 🧍 **Human-written content**

The system provides high accuracy, making it suitable for content authenticity verification.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation**  
   - Input file: `ai_human_content_detection_dataset.csv`  
   - Columns:
     - `text` → the text sample  
     - `label` → `AI` or `Human`

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning, tokenization, and padding of text sequences using Keras `Tokenizer`.

3. **Model Building**
   - The model uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network for contextual text understanding.

4. **Training and Evaluation**
   - The model is trained on 80% of the dataset and validated on 20%.
   - Achieves ~96–98% accuracy on validation data.

5. **Deployment**
   - The model is exported and deployed via a **Flask API** for real-time predictions.
